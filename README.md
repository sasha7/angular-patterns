# Angular Patterns

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of software patterns
covering Data Layer and View Layer of Angular applications.

These patterns are written for use as recipes on top of what Angular Core offers
(Components, Change Detection, Unidirectional data flow, Hierarchical Dependency Injection, Http). 
When building out your application architecture, you can use these patterns as a good starting point,
and adapt them to your needs.

## Patterns covering the Data layer (Services)

### Reactive Services
- Stateless Observable Service
- Stateful Observable Data Service

## Patterns covering the View layer
